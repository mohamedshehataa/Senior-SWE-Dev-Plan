## 💡 Weekly Reflections

### Week 1
**What went well**:
- ✅ Day 1: Two Sum (Hash Map pattern)
- ✅ Day 2: Best Time to Buy Stock (Single-pass pattern)
- ✅ Day 3: Palindrome Number (Two Pointers pattern)
- ✅ Read Java Concurrency in Practice (Ch 1-2)
- ✅ Reading Concurrency Ch 3 (in progress)
- ✅ Learned thread safety, race conditions, synchronization
- ✅ Load balancing fundamentals (L4 vs L7, algorithms) - deep dive complete
- ✅ Connected concepts to production systems
- ✅ Cleaned up repo structure and privacy
- ✅ 3-day streak maintained! 🔥🔥🔥

**What needs improvement**:
- Complete Concurrency Ch 3 (Memory Model)
- Code the BankAccount synchronization example
- Practice coding from scratch without peeking at solutions
- Explain algorithms out loud (interview practice)
- Write STAR stories for previous work experience

**Key learnings**:
- Day 1: Hash maps optimize O(n²) → O(n) via complement search
- Day 2: Single-pass with state tracking (track minPrice)
- Day 3: Two Pointers - half reversal for palindromes (beats 100%)
- Concurrency: Race conditions are REAL, visibility matters
- synchronized keyword prevents concurrent access issues
- Load balancing: L4 (fast) vs L7 (intelligent), 5 algorithms
- Thread pools + load balancing = enterprise-level architecture
- Not every day is perfect - consistency > perfection

**Next 5 days focus**:
- 5 more LeetCode problems (Days 3-7)
- Two Pointers, Stacks, Sliding Window patterns
- Caching strategies, Database concepts
- Write 1-2 STAR stories from work experience
- Sunday: Review week + plan Week 2
