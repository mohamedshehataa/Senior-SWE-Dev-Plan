## 💡 Weekly Reflections

### Week 1
**What went well**:
- ✅ Day 1: Two Sum (Hash Map pattern)
- ✅ Day 2: Best Time to Buy Stock (Single-pass pattern)
- ✅ Read Java Concurrency in Practice (Ch 1-3)
- ✅ Learned thread safety, race conditions, synchronization
- ✅ Load balancing fundamentals (L4 vs L7, algorithms)
- ✅ Connected concepts to PMC production code
- ✅ 2-day streak maintained! 🔥

**What needs improvement**:
- Practice coding from scratch without peeking at solutions
- Explain algorithms out loud (interview practice)
- Write STAR stories for PMC experience

**Key learnings**:
- Day 1: Hash maps optimize O(n²) → O(n) via complement search
- Day 2: Single-pass with state tracking (track minPrice)
- Concurrency: Race conditions are REAL (saw it live in code!)
- synchronized keyword prevents concurrent access issues
- Load balancing = distributing work (same as my PMC task distribution!)
- My BackupThreadPoolService = production thread pool + load balancing!

**Next 5 days focus**:
- 5 more LeetCode problems (Days 3-7)
- Two Pointers, Stacks, Sliding Window patterns
- Caching strategies, Database concepts
- Write 1-2 PMC STAR stories
- Sunday: Review week + plan Week 2
